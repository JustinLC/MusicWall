ToDoList

When a user adds a song/track to the wall, it should record that that user created it.

	Associations - has_many belongs_to
	Add new migration for song_id
	Song created by whom?


Users can upvote any song (once) on the wall
	Upvote Table
	Columns - t.string song_id, t.integer user_id, t.integer votes
	Create upvote/downvote buttons

	def liked(:id)
		@songs = Songs.find
		@like = song.likes.find(current_user)
		if relike and @liked.value == true
			like.dislike
		else
			@like.like
		end
	end

Songs will show how many upvotes they have and be ordered by # of upvotes
